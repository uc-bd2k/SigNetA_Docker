<p>Network analysis of biological systems is increasingly gaining acceptance as a useful method for integration and analysis of gene expression data. SigNetA (Signature Network Analysis) is a web application which provides biologist-friendly user interface for interactive network analysis of large gene expression signature datasets. Users can upload gene IDs, p-values and fold change differential expressions of a gene expression signature to create optimal sub-network from Interactome or STRING human proteome datasets. The user is able to view subnetwork, download generated network data, perform and download GO (Gene Ontology) enrichment analysis. All these functionalities have been integrated within SigNetA to facilitate the interpretation of the subnetwork.<p>
